## Details
I am assuming you have a Mac with XCode installed.  
This app is just 2 pages, with the main screen being the detail screen and the EditScreen being the accessedby a button on the main.  
I used state variables on the main screen and passed them as a binding to the EditScreen.  
The EditScreen is equiped with TextFields and a TextEditor to control the binding on the main screen, as Swift-UI automatically updates it.
Enjoy!!!
